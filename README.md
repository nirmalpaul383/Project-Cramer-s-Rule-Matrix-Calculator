# Project-Cramer-s-Rule-Matrix-Calculator
We can use multiple methods to solve a linear equation. One of them is Cramer's Rule. In this method the value of two or more unknown variables are find. The coefficients of the variables are used to form a matrix and with the help of their determinants, the value of variables are solved. You can find more information about this rule on https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule this page. This program helps user to solve the linear equations and find the value of the unknown variables. This application supports 2x2 and 3x3 linear equations data(2x2 for two unknown variables e.g X,Y and 3X3 for three unknown variables e.g X,Y,Z). This program also shows full processing method (formula wise) for better understanding what is happening...   This application's icon and contains are designed and developed by me (N Paul)  This program is best suitable for stock android with FullHD+ (1080*2160 p) resolution's display. This is an open source project(originally made by me, N Paul) and anybody can view, modify and rebuilt it.
