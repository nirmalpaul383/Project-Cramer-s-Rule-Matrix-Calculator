# Project-Cramer-s-Rule-Matrix-Calculator
About:
      This is an equation solver application based on the Cramer's Rule.

Description:
      We can use multiple methods to solve a linear equation.
      One of them is Cramer's Rule. In this method the value of two or more unknown variables are find.
      The coefficients of the variables are used to form a matrix and with the help of their determinants,
      the value of variables are solved.
      You can find more information about this rule on https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule this page.
      This program helps user to solve the linear equations and find the value of the unknown variables.
      This application supports 2x2 and 3x3 linear equations data(2x2 for two unknown variables e.g X,Y and
      3X3 for three unknown variables e.g X,Y,Z).
      This program also shows full processing method (formula wise) for better understanding what is happening...  

About app compatibility:  
      This application's icon and contains are designed and developed by me (N Paul).
      This program is best suitable for stock android with FullHD+ (1080*2160 p) resolution's display.
      This is an open source project(originally made by me, N Paul) and anybody can view, modify and rebuilt it.

About source project:
      This application is made with Tasker (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm)
      and with Tasker app factory (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.appfactory ).
      To install and run 'Cramer's Rule Calc' you will 'not need' any of this application. However if you want to 'view or modify'
      source file you 'will need' Tasker application and if you want to 'export your own modification' then you 'will need
      both' Tasker and its extension app Tasker app factory.
          
Here is a directory and file guide:
      there are 3 folder
      (1) "Apk file" folder [contains premade/exported 'Cramer_s_Rule_Calc.apk' android application file]

      (2) "Assets" folder [contains several assets(pictures) files for the project (mainly guide pictures and logo/icon
          for the application) and you can even modify them via photoshop.]

      (3)"Project Source" folder [contains main project file. Download it and import it to the tasker app, modify or view
       it and enjoy...]
